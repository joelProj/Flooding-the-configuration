# Flooding-the-configuration

In this repository you can find the algorithm designed by Joel Moreno VÃ zquez, for the purpose of reconfiguring a configuration C into the resulting configuration of flooding C's bounding box with the same amount of modules.

The code corresponding to the algorithm is found in the file main.js found within the Webpage folder.
Further testing scripts and test inputs can be found in the Tests folder as well as the Web simulator code in the Webpage one.
